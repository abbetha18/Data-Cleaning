# Data-Cleaning
The projects in this repository are assignments I completed as part of the Dataquest.io Data Science in Python Bootcamp. These projects focus on cleaning data using different functions in the pandas library.

* Cleaning Data Employee Exit Surveys focuses on clean and analyze exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE)) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia.

* Analyzing NYC High School Data focuses on cleaning multiple datasets that give information about New York City Schools and SAT Scores. The datasets are preped so that they can be joined together in order to see what fields correlate to SAT scores. Some analysis on correlation between SAT scores and other varriables is performed after the data is cleaned.
